It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",

        "# Question 2: Pixel CNN / Pixel RNN (Optional)\n",
        "\n",
        "In this question, we explore **deep autoregressive models** for image generation, focusing on PixelCNN and PixelRNN.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Natural images are high-dimensional and exhibit strong spatial correlations between neighboring pixels. The **PixelRNN** aims to model the **full joint distribution** of pixel intensities, enabling exact likelihood computation and realistic image generation.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike VAEs or GANs, which rely on latent variables or adversarial training, PixelRNN treats the **image as a sequence of pixels** and directly models:  \n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "p(\\mathbf{x}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} p(x_i \\mid x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{i-1})\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, each pixel \\(x_i\\) is conditioned on all previously generated pixels, following a fixed **raster-scan order** (top-left → bottom-right). This transforms image modeling into a **sequence modeling task**, allowing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to capture long-range spatial dependencies.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Core Idea\n",
        "\n",
        "PixelRNN introduces **two-dimensional LSTM architectures** to preserve autoregressive dependencies in images:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Row LSTM:** Processes the image row by row (left-to-right), with recurrent connections across both rows and columns.  \n",
        "- **Diagonal Bi-LSTM:** Processes pixels along diagonals, increasing the receptive field to include all previously generated pixels.  \n",
        "\n",

        "1. **Masked Convolutions**  \n",
        "   Convolutional filters are masked (type A or B) to prevent access to future pixels or channels during training.  \n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Discrete Softmax Output**  \n",

        "\n",
        "4. **Loss Function**  \n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Start at the top-left pixel.  \n",
        "2. Sequentially sample each pixel from its predicted conditional distribution.  \n",
        "3. Repeat until the entire image is generated.  \n",
